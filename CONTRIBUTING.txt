========== BRANCHING PATTERN ==========

    The general branching pattern for this project is to branch off of the "main"
branch to make changes. As you develop on your seperate branch, pull main and merge
it into your branch often. Merge your branch back into main once your change is made
and tested. Discuss with the team if you need to merge a breaking change into the
main branch.

========== STYLE GUIDE ==========

In general, this style guide follows Godot's official GD Script style guide at:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html#gdscript-style-guide

This guide differs from the official guide in two ways:
    Use 4 spaces instead of tabs for indentation (NOT EDITOR DEFAULT)
    Directory names use kebab-case (example: static-animations/)
        -- Note: most directory names will probably be single words, so it's
           really just important to remember to use lowercase



Other quick notes from the guide before starting:
